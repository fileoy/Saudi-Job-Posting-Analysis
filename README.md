# Saudi Job Posting Analysis

This project leverages data storytelling to analyze and simplify the employment landscape in Saudi Arabia for fresh graduates. The goal is to provide actionable insights and alleviate the anxiety of navigating the job market. By focusing on key questions such as job location distribution, gender preferences in job postings, salary expectations for fresh graduates, and opportunities for entry-level vs. experienced professionals, this project empowers job seekers with data-driven recommendations.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the following questions:
- What proportion of job postings is attributed to each region within Saudi Arabia?
- Is there a gender preference indicated in the job postings?
- What is the expected salary range for fresh graduates?
- Are job opportunities predominantly targeted at individuals with experience, or is there room for fresh graduates as well?
